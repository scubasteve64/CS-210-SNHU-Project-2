# CS-210-SNHU-Project-2

The project I chose was project 2 which was a bank company needing me to create software to calculate end of the year and month wages and deductions on a given input.
The point I did well was keeping all the code organized and neat. I made sure my code was working and easy to read with notes.
Honestly, everything was really hard to code. With no background in coding I had to go into this project with very little knowledge. But using my reasources at my disposal at school and the internet. I was able to overcome those issues.

I'd have to say just being able to create working code in C++ will already be a huge advantange going into my next classes
I made sure to include notes and keep my code neat.
